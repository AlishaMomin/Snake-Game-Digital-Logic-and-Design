# Snake-Game-Digital-Logic-and-Design
## OBJECTIVE: 
The aim of this project is to design and implement video game on FPGA board. 
 
## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:   
DLD course project is your opportunity  to design a small digital 
system. You will design, build, debug, demonstrate, and report on this system. This document 
sets  forth  expectations  and  requirements  for  this  project  and  makes  a  few  suggestions  which 
should help to make your project a success. In order to accomplish all that is expected by the end 
of the term, it is essential that you stay on schedule.  
In your project you are required to design a video game (e.g. ping-pong or any variant of it)1 in 
Verilog HDL and implement on  BASYS 03 FPGA board. Your digital system (like other digital 
systems)  will  consist  of  three  key  components  as  shown  in  Figure  01.  Following  are  general 
requirements of project. 
# ● Output Peripheral: 
You are required to have visual display of your project on flat panel 
display (i.e. monitor) using VGA port of BASYS 03 FPGA board.  
Lab 11 will provide you basic understanding and relevant codes to provide basics on this. 
 
# ● FPGA Board (BASYS 03):
You are required to write code using Verilog HDL, synthesize 
and implement all the required logic and processing on BASYS 03 FPGA board. 
See Tutorial Videos on implementation of Verilog modules on FPGA boards. 
 
# ● Input Peripheral(s): 
You are required to have at least one input peripheral like switches, 
keyboard, mouse, joystick etc. in your digital system with which you ‘ll control movement 
of paddle in ping pong game. This will be your design choice.

## PROBLEM GOALS:   
The purpose of this project is to help you obtain necessary skills to develop a hardware-software 
product-oriented  project.  In  particular,  you will  acquire  the following  skillset  after completing 
this project:  
1. Programming digital logic on FPGA. 
2. Design of logic modules involving comparators, multiplexers, encoders, decoders, 
counters and finite state machines 
3. Hardware/Software interfacing.   
4. Hardware/Software debugging.   
5. Interfacing of hardware components i.e. input/output peripherals with FPGA 
6. Basic game development
